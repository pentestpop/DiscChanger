This project is part of an effort to reject the paralysis of choice and respect the effort of music creation by enforcing scarcity with intentionality.

# Future Goals

It would be really cool to find a way to add a certain number of genres to the playlist each time it's updated. For example, to add no more than 3 Workout albums, and to require adding 2 albums tagged in a way that reflects that they are albums I've been meaning to listen to for a while. This can be done with genre somewhat easily, but functionality would be severely limited. For me to do it with Comments or Tags, I need to considerably update the metadata in my library. TBD.
