# README

This project is part of an effort to reject the paralysis of choice and respect the effort of music creation by enforcing scarcity with intentionality. 

Currently the project is merely a AppleScript file which selects 10 albums from my music library at random and adds them to a playlist titled Current Rotation. I can sync this playlist, and only this playlist to my phone, inspiring me to enjoy the music I have collected with purpose. 

# Future Goals

It would be really cool to find a way to add a certain number of genres to the playlist each time it's updated. For example, to add no more than 3 Workout albums, and to require adding 2 albums tagged in a way that reflects that they are albums I've been meaning to listen to for a while. This can be done with genre somewhat easily, but functionality would be severely limited. For me to do it with Comments or Tags, I need to considerably update the metadata in my library. TBD.
